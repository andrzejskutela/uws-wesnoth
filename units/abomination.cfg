    description="Of the living, only the priesthood know of the existence of these twisted, scarcely-recognisable remnants of Elves.  Losing control of the Bestia has warped them almost beyond recognition, and increased their strength and agility to levels which are unmatched by any in Meridia.  They are kept restrained beneath the temples, and released only in times of the direst need, when enemies are all about, and their raw, unbridled fury can be put to good use."
